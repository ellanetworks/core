# Operator Information

## PLMN ID

The Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID is a globally unique identifier for a mobile network. It consists of a Mobile Country Code (MCC) and a Mobile Network Code (MNC). The PLMN ID is used by mobile devices to identify and select the network to which they will connect.

Network operators are assigned a PLMN ID by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). There is a limited number of PLMN-IDs available, getting one for private networks can be challenging.

If you are interested in obtaining a PLMN ID for your private network, and going through the ITU route is unreasonable, you can get a shared PLMN ID from the Alliance for Private Networks. For more information, refer to their [Network Identifier Program](https://www.mfa-tech.org/network-identifier-program/#:~:text=The%20PLMN%20ID%20identifies%20a,in%20any%20available%20spectrum%20today).
