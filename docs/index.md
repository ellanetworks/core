**Ella Core** is an open-source 5G mobile core network built for private deployments. It simplifies the complexity of traditional 5G networks into a single, easy-to-operate solution that is reliable and secure.

Use Ella Core where you need 5G connectivity: in a factory, a warehouse, a farm, a stadium, a ship, a military base, or a remote location.

## Key features

- **5G Compliant**: Deploy Ella Core with 5G radios and devices. Ella Core's interfaces follow 3GPP standards.
- **Performant Data Plane**: Achieve high throughput and low latency with an eBPF-based data plane. Ella Core delivers over 3 Gbps of throughput and less than 2 ms of latency.
- **Lightweight**: Ella Core is a single binary with an embedded database, making it easy and quick to stand up. It requires as little as 2 CPU cores, 2GB of RAM, and 10GB of disk space. Forget specialized hardware; all you need to operate your 5G core network is a Linux system with four network interfaces.
- **Intuitive User Experience**: Manage subscribers, radios, profiles, and operator information through a user-friendly web interface. Automate network operations with a complete REST API.
- **Real-Time Observability**: Access detailed metrics, traces, and dashboards to monitor network health through the UI, the Prometheus-compliant API, or an OpenTelemetry collector.
- **Backup and Restore**: Backup and restore the network configuration and data.
- **Audit Logs**: Keep track of all operations performed on the network.
