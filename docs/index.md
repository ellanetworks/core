Ella Core is a 5G mobile core network for private deployments. It is designed to be easy to operate, reliable, and secure.

Typical mobile networks are complex, expensive, and difficult to operate. Forget microservices, external databases, complex configurations, and expensive hardware. Ella Core is a single binary that runs on a single machine.

Use Ella Core where you need 5G connectivity: in a factory, a warehouse, a farm, a stadium, a ship, a military base, or a remote location.
