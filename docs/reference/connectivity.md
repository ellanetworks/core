# Connectivity

Ella Core uses 4 different interfaces by default:

- **API**: The HTTP API and UI (HTTPS:5002)
- **N2**: The control plane interface between Ella Core and the 5G Radio (SCTP:38412)
- **N3**: The user plane interface between Ella Core and the 5G Radio (SCTP:2152)
- **N6**: The user plane interface between Ella Core and the internet

# Combining interfaces

It is possible to combine interfaces in the following manners.

## Combined N2 and N3

Many gNodeBs can use a single network link towards the core. In this case,
N2 and N3 can be combined by using the same interface name for both of them in the
configuration file.

## Combined API and N6

The API interface is often the management interface with internet access,
and the N6 interface also requires internet access. They can be combined by using
the same interface name for both in the configuration file.

## Combined API/N6 and combined N2/N3

It is possible to use both combination together to reduce the requirements
to 2 interfaces.

While this is the minimum requirements for Ella Core, one or both of these
interfaces can be virtual interfaces, with `veth`. Refer to your
distribution's documentation on how to set this up.
