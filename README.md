Ella Core is a 5G mobile core network for private deployments. It is designed to be easy to operate, reliable, and secure.

Typical mobile networks are complex, expensive, and difficult to operate. Forget microservices, external databases, complex configurations, and expensive hardware. Ella Core is a single binary that runs on a single machine.

Use Ella Core where you need 5G connectivity: in a factory, a warehouse, a farm, a stadium, a ship, a military base, or a remote location.

## Key features

- **5G compliant**: Deploy Ella Core with 5G radios and devices. Ella Core's interfaces follow 3GPP standards.
- **Intuitive UI**: Manage subscribers, radios, profiles, and operator information through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Extensive HTTP API**: Automate network operations with a complete REST API.
- **Real-Time  Observability**: Access detailed metrics and dashboards to monitor network health through the UI and the Prometheus-compliant API.
- **Backup and restore**: Backup and restore the network configuration and data.

## Tenets

Building Ella Core, we make engineering decisions based on the following tenets:

1. **Simplicity**: We are committed to developing the simplest possible mobile core network user experience. We thrive on having a very short Getting Started tutorial, a simple configuration file, a single binary, an embedded database, and a simple UI.
2. **Reliability**: We are commited to developing a reliable mobile network you can trust to work 24/7. We are committed to delivering high-quality code, tests, and documentation. We are committed to exposing dashboards, metrics, and logs to help users monitor their networks.
3. **Security**: We are committed to minimizing the private network's attack surface and using secure encryption protocols to protect our users' data. We are committed to identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
