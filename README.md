Ella Core is a 5G mobile core network for private deployments. It is designed to be easy to operate, reliable, and secure.

Typical mobile networks are complex, expensive, and difficult to operate. Forget microservices, external databases, complex configurations, and expensive hardware. Ella Core is a single binary that runs on a single machine.

Use Ella Core where you need 5G connectivity: in a factory, a warehouse, a farm, a stadium, a ship, a military base, or a remote location.

## Key features

* **5G compliant**: Deploy Ella Core with 5G radios and devices. Ella Core's interfaces follow 3GPP standards.
* **Intuitive UI**: Manage subscribers, radios, profiles, and operator information through a user-friendly web interface.
* **Extensive HTTP API**: Automate network operations with a complete REST API.
* **Real-Time  Observability**: Access detailed metrics and dashboards to monitor network health, both through the UI and the Prometheus compliant API.
* **Backup and restore**: Backup and restore the network configuration and data.

## Tenets

Building Ella Core, we make engineering decisions based on the following tenets:

1. **Simplicity**: We are commited to develop the simplest possible mobile network out there. We thrive on having a very short "Getting Started" tutorial, a simple configuration file, a single binary, an embedded database, and a simple UI.
2. **Reliability**: We are commited to develop a reliable mobile network you can trust to work 24/7. We are commited to deliver high quality code, tests, and documentation. We are commited to expose dashboards, metrics and logs to help users monitor their network.
3. **Security**: We are commited to minimizing the attack surface of the private network and to use secure encryption protocols to protect the data of our users. We are commited to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
